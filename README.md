Random scripts from previous projects.

### Image As Camera (Add-on)
Add-on to allow user to import an image as a camera from the Add menu. Currently very simple, but in the future I'd like to add options to sync focal length and other settings with EXIF data. This is time consuming though because each image format has it's own spec.

### Light Panel (Add-on)
This add-on is basically a very lightweight alternative to Greg Zaal's Gaffer add-on. It displays each light in a panel and allows basic adjustment. I mainly use this for quick lookdev work in Eevee when I want to be in full screen mode and still adjust lights.

### randomize_lat_lng
Base script for getting random earth location. In retrospect, not very useful since most points are over the ocean. A better solution would link to a GIS database.

### simple_random_script
Another base script for random adjustments. Useful for dataset generation. This is super obvious stuff. I wrote this while still learning BPY.
