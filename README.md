## Image As Camera
Add-on to allow user to import an image as a camera from the Add menu. Currently very simple, but in the future I'd like to add options to sync focal length and other settings with EXIF data. This is time consuming though because each image format has it's own spec.

## Light Panel
This add-on is basically a very lightweight alternative to Greg Zaal's Gaffer add-on. It displays each light in a panel and allows basic adjustment. I mainly use this for quick lookdev work in Eevee when I want to be in full screen mode and still adjust lights.
